# Econometrics.jl

This package provides the functionality to estimate the following regression models:

- Continuous Response Models
  - Ordinary Least Squares (Stata's `reg`/`ivregress 2sls`)
  - Longitudinal estimators
    - Random effects model Ã  la [Swamy Arora](https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1909405) (Stata's `xtreg`/`xtivreg`)
    - Between estimator (Stata's `xtreg, be`)
- Nominal Response Model
  - Multinomial logistic (softmax) regression (Stata's `mlogit`)
- Ordinal Response Model
  - Proportional Odds Logistic Regression (Stata's `ologit`)

In addition, models incorporate the following features:
  - Implements the StatsBase.jl `StatisticalModel`/`RegressionModel` [API](http://juliastats.github.io/StatsBase.jl/latest/statmodels/)
  - Support for frequency weights
  - Robust Variance Covariance Estimators (e.g., heteroscedasticity consistent)
  - Instrumental Variables Model through Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)
  - Feature absorption for estimating a subset of parameters with high dimensional fixed effects as controls efficiently
